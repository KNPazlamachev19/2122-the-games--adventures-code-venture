  <h1><i>Lava Cube - Rules</i></h1><br><br>
  
  <h2>Life</h2>
  <p>You have an infinite number of lives. You can try until you break your keyboard.<p><br>
  
  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>In our game you can move when you use a combination of keys on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>Here you can see how this happens:</p><br>
  <p>To move forward, press the "W" key on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>To move to the right, press the "D" key on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>To move to the left, press the "A" key on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>To move backwards, press the "S" key on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>To jump, press the "Space" key on the keyboard.</p><br>
  
  <h2>Platforms</h2>
  <p>They are four types of platforms in our game “Normal”, “Finish”, “Spawn point” and “Moving platform”.</p><br>
  
  <p>“Normal”- This platform is static, so it cannot move and you can stand on it normally.</p><br>
  <p>“Moving platform”- This platform is not static and if you want to stay on it,</p>
  <p> you have to move with it, otherwise you will fall into the lava. For this you shouldn't stay too much on it.</p><br>
  
  <p>“Spawn point”- This platform is static, if you stay too long on the "Moving Platform" you'll fall into the</p>
   <p>lava and die. You don't have to be afraid because you don't have to start the game over. </p>
  <p>If you step on the "Spawn point" platform before you fall, you will come to life on it.</p>
   <p>It looks like a plaid "Normal" platform with yellow and black squares.</p><br>
   
  <p>“Finish” - This platform is static if you stepp on it you will complete this level and will go on to the next.</p>
  <p>It looks like a plaid "Normal" platform with white and black squares.</p><br>
